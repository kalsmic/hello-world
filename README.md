# hello-world
The Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. It is a simple exercise that will get me started when learning something new.

Hello Friends!
Arthur is my name, a personate programmer who seeks to learn more and more by day. I love exposing myself to challenges because they trigger me to think and learn new things. This being my first project on git hub i seek to learn more and more about the best practices on how to use git to effect version control and enhance collaboration between the different stake holders. I believe that by the end of this simple practice problem set that i will be able to have a basic understanding on how to use git. 
And of course, am not limited by any boundaries, real or imaginary. I can do all things through Christ which gives me strength.

**Thanks for being a part of my learning journey**
**BE BLESSED**
